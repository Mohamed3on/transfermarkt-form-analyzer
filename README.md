# FormTracker

Football scouting dashboards built on Transfermarkt data.

- Live app: https://football-form.vercel.app
- Public repo: https://github.com/Mohamed3on/formtracker

## What It Covers

- Recent club form across multiple match windows
- Team value vs actual table position
- Player explorer (market value, minutes, G+A, loans/new signings)
- Value analysis (bargains vs underperforming value)
- Injury impact by player, club, and injury type
- Curated discovery boards at `/discover`

## Local Development

```bash

bun run lint

Refresh local minutes/value snapshot:

```bash
bun run refresh:minutes-value
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Recommended | Canonical base URL for sitemap/metadata |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Optional | Required only for `/api/refresh-data` |

## Caching And Refresh

- Transfermarkt-backed fetches use `unstable_cache` tags.
- `POST /api/revalidate` clears Next.js cache tags for live scraped pages.
- `POST /api/refresh-data` dispatches `refresh-data.yml` on GitHub for static-data pages (`/players`, `/value-analysis`), so refresh is asynchronous by design.
