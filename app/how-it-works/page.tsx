            <p>
              Which teams are on the hottest or coldest streaks right now, based on actual match results (all competitions, not just league games).

            <p>
              We look at 4 time frames: a team&apos;s <Term>last 5, 10, 15, and 20 matches</Term>.
              Shorter windows catch recent momentum shifts; longer ones reveal sustained trends.

            <p>

            <ul className="mt-1.5 ml-4 list-disc space-y-1">
              <li><Term>Points</Term> — 3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss</li>

            <p>
              A team must lead (or trail) <Term>2 or more categories</Term> within at least one window to appear.
              We then count how many total category appearances each team has across all 4 windows and rank by that count.
              The team with the most is the form leader.

            <p>
              <Term>PPG (Points Per Game)</Term> is the manager&apos;s average points per match at this club.
              The ranking (e.g. &ldquo;2/7&rdquo;) compares them to all managers at the same club with a similar number of games, going back to 1995.

              and as a &ldquo;biggest faller&rdquo; if it has dropped repeatedly. Ranked by total absolute change.
